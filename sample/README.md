# Ultralite SDK Sample for iOS
This software is a sample application built using the [Ultralite SDK for iOS](https://github.com/Vuzix/UltraliteSDK-releases-iOS).  It shows several example use cases for controlling various types of content on the Vuzix Z100™ smart glasses display.

This is intended to allow developers to quickly become familiar with the capabilities of the Ultralite SDK, and learn how to easily add support for the Vuzix Z100™ smart glasses in their own applications.
